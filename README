my_env
======
This tool builds my ~/dotfiles based on runtime options. Example usage:
./my_env.py --method={ write | symlink } --target={ linux | osx }

The first option declares whether to write new files in the home directory, or to create symlinks back to the generated files in the build directory. This argument is required.

The second option declares the host architecture type.



The .bash_aliases* files are not included in the public repository. This is intentional.
